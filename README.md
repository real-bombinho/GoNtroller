NTC is a simple unit to read an NTC sensor, here in a voltage divider with a 47kOhm to ground
Sensor in use is a Sourcing Map 100K Temperature Sensor Probe NTC
A,B and C have only been roughly calculated as my reference temperature probe was down on battery.

Relay is a simple unit allowing to constantly loop through the setter as switching only gets done
when the relay state is to change and the last changing time is stored and can be called up.
